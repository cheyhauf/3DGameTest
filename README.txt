A simple demonstration of the 3D workflow from the open source 3D modeling software, Blender, into the open source game engine Godot. The engine showcases some simple game mechanics such as raytracing for interaction within the world, as well as linearlly interpolated, or mathematically smooth movement using a simplified workflow within the engine's editor. 

The rendering pipeline is somewhat demanding, although debugging and testing nets me consistent 30-40 fps on an aging laptop.

The controls are pretty simple, wasd will control the directional movement of your character with the mouse allowing a dynamic and self controlled 3rd person view.
Pressing the space bar will a vertical jump that is currently way to high but allows for just slightly expanded gameplay.
Moving near an object and facing toward it will prompt a "Press to e interact" on the screen, in which a miniscule gameplay event will trigger.

Pressing esc will open the pause menu and this can be done at any time, although pressing q will instantly terminate the game as well.
